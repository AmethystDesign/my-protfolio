          I have worked with Jun for the past 4 years. I feel that Jun is highly qualified for this position at your company for several reasons.
           Jun is an important contributor to many of our projects. Jun consistently delivers high quality work products,
            meets or exceeds deadlines, and assists her co-workers at every opportunity.
             When we were under an especially strict timeline on a recent project, Jun worked a lot of overtime to ensure the client was pleased.

          Jun is a joy to work with. He handled our Web page assignment with aplomb and diligence, 
          displaying the ability to follow creative direction while adding his own creative input in a diplomatic and useful way.
